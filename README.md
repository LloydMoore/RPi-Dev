RPi-Dev
=======
The RPi-DEV board is designed to be a flexible development
and prototyping platform for both the Raspberry Pi and PSoC
ecosystems. The board has the functionality needed for real
time embedded projects. The heart of the board is a Cypress
PSoC  processor allowing user programmable analog and digital
circuitry based on the target project. The board has 8
high current drivers which form a configurable motor 
controller, RS-232/485 driver, 3 Diligent PMOD connectors,
and 18 additional I/O.
